Following are the expectations:

1. We would like to see how you solve the problem using TDD. In case if you are not familiar/comfortable with TDD, you can write plain-old automated unit tests (POUTs). Automated Unit tests are mandatory for us to validate your code.
2. Write smaller methods/functions. Follow Single Responsibility Principle/Programming by intention.
3. Make sure your code is compiled
4. Upload your code in Github
5. Write some explanation about the following while you upload your code in Github.
· Your approach. How did you come up with your solution? Details on the functions
· Consider​ ​complexity.​ ​How​ ​fast​ ​does​ ​your​ ​code​ ​run?​ ​How​ ​does​ ​it​ ​scale?
· ​Consider​ ​cases​ ​where​ ​we​ ​want​ ​​N​ ​primes.
6. ​Do​ ​not​ ​use​ ​the​ ​standard prime number classes available​(write​ ​your​ ​own​ ​code).

It would be great if you could send us the solution by tomorrow afternoon.
We would get into the next round of discussions based on your solution. If you have any questions, please do reach out to us.
